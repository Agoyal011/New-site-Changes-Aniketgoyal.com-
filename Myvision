Hi! Thank you for showing the curiosity .Lets get to know more about me. 
</div>

<div class="myvision" > 
My name is Aniket and I come from India. I was born in Northwestestern part of India in a province named Punjab. However, from past four years I have been living in Canada.
I have pursued my Bacherlor's here in Mechatronics Engineering (Hons) with minoring in AI and Machine learning and got graduated in June 2023.
The expirience had been very good since it was the first time for me stepping out of my home, there were lot of learnings, challenges which I admire
and most importantly I got to know myself even more. Over the course of time I realized I am more of a people's person and like to deal with mass
audiences. So I look forward to go into entrapreneruship, technical sales or anything which involves interaction. 

Apart from the academics, I like to read books in my free time. My other hobbies include listening to podcasts, music, and fashion. I have also
developed significant interest in spirituality.
